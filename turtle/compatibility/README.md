The compatibility directory is for testing browser compatibility.

WebLogo depends on some fairly recent features in ECMAscript and some old browsers don't support them all.
The compatibility/index.html file is a page for reporting various information about
the browser to see what, if anything, doesn't work due to browser compatibility issues.
