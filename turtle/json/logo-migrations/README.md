The logo-migrations directory contains information on various other Logo interpreters mainly to help
WebLogo recognize code from those tools and convert them to more WebLogo-valid code.

This data can help WebLogo generally be more compatible and consistent with other Logo programming tools.

prototypes/logo-migration-insights.html uses the information from this directory to find various insights that could be 
useful for WebLogo's command list.

Apple Logo, Terrapin Logo, and Krell Logo are essentially different names for the same programming tools.
I made separate migration files for Apple Logo and Terrapin 3 Logo but they're different versions of the same software.
The Krell company bought Terrapin.  None of these were produced by Apple.  They were made for Apple 2 computers.
