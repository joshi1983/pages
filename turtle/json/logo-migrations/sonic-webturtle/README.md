The colors.json colors are from http://www.sonic.net/~nbs/webturtle/commands/colors.shtml

One exception to that colour table is yellow.

The following WebTurtle code shows #FFFF00 instead of #AAAA00 from the colour table.
thick 20
COLOR 4

COLOR YELLOW

The order of colors is important as it corresponds with index numbers that are sometimes used by the color command.
