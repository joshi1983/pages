Each fixer targets a specific type of changes to fix errors that would prevent compiling to intermediate code instructions.

These fixers are related to the validators and tip generators in parsing/parseTreeAnlysis.  The validators and tip generators point out problems and how to fix them.  
The fixers take that a step farther by actually performing the suggested changes.
