		<title>AVIF File Format Downloading Prototype</title>

		<p>This prototype demonstrates saving and downloading an image in 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVIF" target="_empty">AVIF file format</a>.</p>
		<p>
		This ends up saving to PNG format in Microsoft Edge 123.0.2420.53.
		I can't get it to save to AVIF because native browser support to write AVIF 
		isn't in any web browser I know of as I type this in 2024.
		This prototype could still be helpful for testing that as
		new web browser versions get released, though.  This prototype could also be useful for testing a future 
		JavaScript that polyfills or substitutes for the missing native browser feature.</p>
