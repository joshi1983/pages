The prototypes directory contains a few prototypes or resources to help prototypes up one directory.

The prototypes are very small web pages which demonstrate tiny working examples of specific features.

For example, the gifPrototype demonstrates usage of the jsGif library to make an animated GIF.
The downscalePrototype demonstrates downscaling an image interactively to manually test that the downscaling worker and associated libraries work correctly.
