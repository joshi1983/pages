Adding a command for no reason other than to copy other Logo programming tools doesn't seem like a net benefit since it becomes an additional command to document, maintain for people maintaining the WebLogo project.  It also becomes an extra command to teach, and learn.  This effort is worth it if the command is something people will actually use reasonably frequently but pen and setPen seems like it would almost never need to be used."
