		"primaryName": "ceiling",
		"to": "ceiling",
		"description": "Returns the lowest integer greater than or equal to the specified number.  Although this doesn't convert anything, this entry indicates that Net Logo supports the command which could be useful for classifying code as coming from NetLogo.  Not a lot of other Logo interpreters support ceiling."

		"names": ["ht"],
		"to": "hideTurtle",
		"description": "Hides the turtle.  It is note-worthy partly because 'hide-turtle' is not a valid identifier in WebLogo and can't be used for a procedure or command."

	{
		"primaryName": "ifelse-value",
		"to": "ifelse",
		"description": "This is similar to the trinary operator ? : from other programming languages.  ifelse in WebLogo can work like the trinary expression operator and like an if-else statement.  Converting ifelse-value to ifelse in WebLogo requires a little more work, though.  You also need to remove square brackets around the values to make the code work in the same way as in NetLogo."
	},
	{
		"primaryName": "jump",
		"to": "forward",
		"description": "It is tempting to translate to jumpForward but the documentation isn't clear about whether it draws a trail or not.  The lack of clarity combined with saying it is like forward except it moves faster made me think forward is a better WebLogo-equivalent command."

		"primaryName": "pen-mode",
		"description": "Returns the pen mode as a string like 'up', 'down' or 'erase'.  The closest command in WebLogo is penDown? but it isn't similar enough to indicate for automatic translation."

		"primaryName": "replace-item",
		"description": "Replaces an item from a list at a specified index.  The closest command in WebLogo is setItem.  setItem mutates a list and doesn't return the result, though.  setItem just mutates the value of a variable.  setItem in WebLogo is too different from remove-item in NetLogo to automatically translate to setItem here."
	},
	{
		"primaryName": "rgb",
		"description": "Returns a list of the 3 numbers after checking that they are all between 0 and 255.  The closest command in WebLogo is list. list expects 2 parameters, though.  The best WebLogo equivalent would be to wrap the 3 parameters in square brackets and not call a command at all."
