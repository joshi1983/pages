The logo-migrations directory contains information on various other Logo interpreters mainly to help
WebLogo recognize code from those tools and convert them to more WebLogo-valid code.

This data can help WebLogo generally be more compatible and consistent with other Logo programming tools.

prototypes/logo-migration-insights.html uses the information from this directory to find various insights that could be
