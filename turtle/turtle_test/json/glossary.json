		"A <strong>recipe</strong>.  The problem would be needing the food or drink.",
		"A <strong>sequence of steps for creating a flag</strong>.  The problem would be that we need to make a flag.",
		"A <strong>sequence of instructions for drawing a picture</strong>.  The problem would be needing the picture.",
		"A <strong>route or travel plan</strong>.  In other words, a sequence of turns for going from one place to another.  Paint by number and string art templates are some more specific examples.",
		"<strong>Musical notes</strong>.  The problem would be wanting to play or hear music.  In other words, instructions on time, duration, and sequence to play or sing different pitches.  MIDI files are essentially a digital equivalent to musical notes which are played by simulated instruments.",
		"A <strong>plan</strong>.  The problem would be wanting to reach the goal of the plan.",
		"A <strong>procedure</strong>.  The problem would be the goal of the procedure."

Making a frame from many snapshots can also simulate motion blur and help you see motion despite having a static image.  While an animation often spans several seconds of time.  A frame often spans a tiny fraction of a second akin to the shutter speed or exposure length of a camera.</p>",

	"definition": "A technique for repeating instructions that involves a procedure calling itself.  The simplest and most recognizable form of recursion is where a procedure calls itself directly.  If a procedure calls other procedures that then call the first procedure, you'll have indirect recursion."

If you made an animation of a gun firing at realistic speeds, a snapshot would shot a perfectly sharp bullet but a frame made from a huge number of snapshots would show a streak along the path of the bullet.</p>",
