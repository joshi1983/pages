# drawing/vector

This folder contains various classes that will be used for representing 2D drawings and 3D models generated using Logo turtle programs.

These drawings or 3D models will be a common central format for data that gets exported to many 2D and 3D file formats.
It also gets interactively viewed through the "graphics screen" in WebLogo.
