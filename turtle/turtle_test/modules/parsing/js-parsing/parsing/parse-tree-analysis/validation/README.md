This validation directory is analogous to WebLogo's validation in modules/parsing/parse-tree-analysis/validation.

Validation for the JavaScript parse trees is used to test the software.  We may not show JavaScript validation messages to end-users of WebLogo
but we want to verify that the JavaScript parser is working well.  One way of testing the JavaScript parser is 
to parse a bunch of JavaScript and check that the resulting parse tree passes a variety of validation checks.
