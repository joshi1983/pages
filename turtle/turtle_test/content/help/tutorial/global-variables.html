<p>A variable is a symbol with an associated value.  The value can vary or change but the name of a given variable is always the same.</p>
<p>You can assign a value to a global variable using the <span class="command">make command</span>.</p>
<p>The following example makes the variable named x have the value 3 and then prints it.</p>
<code class="pastable">make "x 3<br>
; Makes x equal to 3.<br>
<br>
print :x<br>
; prints the value of x which is 3<br>
</code>

<p>Variables help make your code more flexible and less repetitive.  Consider the following code that draws a triangle:</p>
<code class="pastable">forward 100<br>
right 120<br>
forward 100<br>
right 120<br>
forward 100<br>
right 120</code>
<p>If you wanted the square to have sides of length 150 instead of 100, you'd have to update 3 lines of code to this:</p>
<code class="pastable">forward <mark>150</mark><br>
right 120<br>
forward <mark>150</mark><br>
right 120<br>
forward <mark>150</mark><br>
right 120</code>
<p>After using a variable to represent the length of each side, you can change the size of every side by modifying only 1 line.</p>
<code class="pastable">make "sideLength <mark>150</mark><br>
forward <mark>:sideLength</mark><br>
right 120<br>
forward <mark>:sideLength</mark><br>
right 120<br>
forward <mark>:sideLength</mark><br>
right 120</code>
<p>A good variable name also helps you describe what you're representing to make your code more understandable to the next person who reads it.</p>

<p>It also must follow these rules:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A variable name must not contain any spaces.</li>
	<li>A variable name can start with underscore(_) or a letter.</li>
	<li>Any character after the first can be a period(.), underscore(_), a digit, or a letter.</li>
	<li>A variable name can end with a question mark(?).  The ? can not appear anywhere except at the end.</li>
</ul>
