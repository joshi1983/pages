<p>WebLogo is easy to learn.  WebLogo is focused on creating drawings, animations, and 3D models.
That focus helps WebLogo be one of the best Logo programming environments for graphics.</p>

<p>Upon opening WebLogo, you'll see two sections.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Graphics Screen</strong> - a place to view the current drawing</li>
	<li><strong>Commander</strong> - a place to enter single-line commands</li>
</ul>
<p>We will run commands in the text input at the bottom of the Commander.  
Click the "Run" button or press the ENTER key to run your commands.</p>
<p>The Commander also has an area above the command input box to show a history of previously run commands.</p>
