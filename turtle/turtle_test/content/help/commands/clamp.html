<code>print clamp 1 2 3
; prints 2 because 1 is less than 2
; 2 is the minimum that can be returned.

print clamp 2.5 2 3
; prints 2.5 because 2.5 is between 2 and 3
; In other words, 2.5 does not violate the minimum or maximum constraint on the output.

print clamp 3.5 2 3
; prints 3 because 3 is the maximum possible output.</code>
