	<p>
	Every variable and parameter in the Logo programming language
	has a value.  Each value is part of at least one data type.
	</p>
	<p>A datatype is a set of values.  For example, the number type represents the set of all numbers.
	Values such as 1000, -15, 1, 3.14 are all numbers.  In WebLogo, some values can fit into multiple data types.
	For example, 5 is both a number and a color.
	As a color, 5 is the 5<sup>th</sup> color from a color palette which is
	<span style="background-color: #f0f;height: 14px;width:14px;display:inline-block;margin:0 3px"></span>Fuschia.
	</p>
	<p>Some datatypes have nearly infinite possible values such as list.  Some other data types have very few.
	True and false are the only boolean values.</p>
	<p>Unlike some other programming languages,
	Logo never requires you to explicitly declare parameters or variables as specific data types.
	Instead, data types are checked at 2 times and in 2 different ways.
	<ol>
		<li>As you type code, your code is thoroughly checked for datatype-related problems and
	you're shown red error indicators on the left side of any line with an error.
	Usually and ideally, most datatype problems are found and alerted to you as you type.</li>
		<li>If the static analysis mentioned before doesn't find a problem, you can run the program.
		As your WebLogo code runs, additional type checks are done.
		A datatype error found at runtime will halt your
		program with an exception or error message shown in Commander.
		Unless you edited code as it ran, you should also see a green indicator in Code Editor at the line where the problem stopped.
		The error message should help you fix the code near the most recently executed line of code.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	The following code will show an error because hello is not a number and forward requires a number.</p>
	<code class="pastable">forward "hello</code>
