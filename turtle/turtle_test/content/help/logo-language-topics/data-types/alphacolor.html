<p>An alphacolor or semitransparent color is a color with an associated opacity.</p>
<p>An alphacolor can be desribed in a few different ways:</p>
<ul class="alphacolor-list">
	<li>A name such as "red "green "blue "yellow...  The opacity is assumed to be 100%(or 255) when you use a color name.</li>
	<li>A 3-digit or 6-digit RGB hex code such as #123 or #112233.  The opacity is assumed to be 100%(or 255) when you don't specify opacity.</li>
	<li>An ARGB hex color code such as #f123 or #ff112233.  The opacity is taken from the first digit or digits.  In both of these examples, it would be 255 or 100%.
	#80112233 would have an opacity of 128 which is roughly 50%.  That is 128/255 * 100%.</li>
</ul>
