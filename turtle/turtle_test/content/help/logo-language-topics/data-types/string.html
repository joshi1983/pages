<p>A string is a data type for representing textual information like "hello or 'hello world'.
A string in a computer programming context almost always is short for character-string or
characters that have been connected/strung together into a sequence.
A string data type is very different from the kind of colorful string/thread/fabric of material used in string-art and clothing.</p>
<p>
A string is usually indicated starting with a quote symbol and
followed by the characters of your word.</p>
<p>
For example, <code><span class="command">print</span> "hello</code>
</p>
<p>
Another way to represent a string is by beginning and ending with an apostrophe.
This apostrophe format is most useful to indicate long strings containing multiple
words, spaces, or special characters.  The long string literal format is used for URL's too.
