<p>A property list is a collection of key-value pairs.  
Most programming languages have similar data types but under names such as hash tables,
hash maps, dictionaries, or objects.</p>
<p>A property list is created with the <span class="command">createPList command</span>.
You use the <span class="command">setProperty command</span> to associate a
given property name or key to a given value.
A property and corresponding value or key-value pair can be removed using the
<span class="command">removeProperty command</span>.
A value can be read using the <span class="command">getProperty command</span>.</p>
<p>Property lists are used by commands such as 
<span class="command">createLinearGradient</span> and
<span class="command">createRadialGradient</span> to represent color stops.</p>
