<p>The Shapes Explorer is accessed by clicking <strong>Drawing</strong> -&gt; <strong>Shapes</strong> in the main menu.</p>
<p>The Shapes Explorer lets you see the sequence of shapes used in your current drawing in an interactive spreadsheet-like format.
The <span data-helpID="graphics-screen">graphics screen</span> shows the drawing as a single image 
which is generally the most useful.  Shapes Explorer could help with:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>troubleshooting</strong>.  By showing all details about every shape, you can learn more about how mistakes in code lead to unintended changes in the shapes of the drawing.</li>
	<li><strong>optimizing</strong> your code to produce a drawing with fewer or simpler shapes.  How many shapes can be a useful metric to optimize for while retaining an intended general appearance.</li>
</ul>
