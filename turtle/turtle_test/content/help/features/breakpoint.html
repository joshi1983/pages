<p>A breakpoint is a point in code that will automatically pause the program immediately before it runs.</p>

<p>You can add a breakpoint by clicking in the column to the left of your code.
The corresponding breakpoint will be added at or after the clicked line.</p>
<p>A breakpoint can be removed by clicking on the breakpoint indicator.</p>

<p>Some lines of code have no underlying instructions which is why some lines will be skipped.  
This is obvious when the line of code is blank or has only a comment.</p>
