<p>Clicking <strong>Set</strong> -&gt; <strong>Animation Time</strong> opens a dialog for setting the time that the
<span class="command">animation.time command</span> returns.  The selected time applies to code run from the
<span data-helpId="commander">Commander</span> or when you run your code from the
<span data-helpId="code-editor">Code Editor</span>.</p>

<h3>Live Redraw</h3>
<p>Check <strong>Live Redraw</strong> to see the effect of a newly selected time by having WebLogo clear, rerun, and
redraw the drawing in the dialog's background as you drag the selected time.
The Live Redraw checkbox is checked automatically as the dialog opens whenever the current program makes use of the
<span class="command">animation.time command</span>.</p>
<p>Uncheck <strong>Live Redraw</strong> if you don't like having it redraw in the background</p>
<h3>Selecting a time</h3>
<p>You can select a time in a couple different ways.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can click or drag the range selector.</li>
	<li>Click on the seconds and you can type a number of seconds or use the spinner's up/down buttons.</li>
</ul>
