dt-python-parser is generated by running the command:
browserify browserify index.js -o dt-python-parser.js
BUTTT don't do this until the following bug is fixed:
https://github.com/DTStack/dt-python-parser/issues/24
There is an improvement directly in dt-python-parser.js to help with that bug.
Generating dt-python-parser.js from the nodeJS modules will overwrite the improvement.

uglifyjs "dt-python-parser.js" -o "dt-python-parser.min_.js"

Add the copyright to the top of dt-python-parser.min.js by running the following in Windows:
copy /b copyright.txt + dt-python-parser.min_.js dt-python-parser.min.js
The /b is to binary-copy since dt-python-parser.min_.js will have some non-ASCII data.

You can install browserify using:
npm install -g browserify

You can install uglify-js using:
npm install -g uglify-js

You will also need to initialize the directory.

copyright.txt exists to help DTPythonParser retain the original copyright notice in its minified version(dt-python-parser.min.js).
