The CSS language is documented at:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Syntax

There are some existing CSS parsers for JavaScript. 
Making a new one seemed better than using one of them, though.
The dt-python-parser was difficult to work with and bugs were difficult to work around or fix.
Making a new CSS parser that fits better in this project seems better than the
difficulties that would likely come with workarounds and fixing bugs in one of
the existing CSS parsers.
