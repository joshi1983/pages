tests/parsing/basic/qbasic contains many tests for modules at modules/parsing/basic/qbasic.

prototypes/basic/qbasic-parsing contains a tool for interactively testing the parsing of QBasic code and translation to WebLogo.

An emulator for QBASIC 1.1 can be found at https://archive.org/details/msdos_qbasic_megapack
Emulated QBASIC 1.1 is the most accurate single point of truth for how QBASIC code should behave and
how the language should be defined.  Some QB64 features were implemented based on documentation at https://qb64.com/
which are not expected to work in QBASIC 1.1, though.

A second tool that can be helpful is at https://qbjs.org/.
qbjs was written from scratch in JavaScript so it has some inconsistency with the real QBASIC
but qbjs can be faster to paste code into.
