Most of these examples are from https://github.com/blackrushllc/basil/releases/tag/Beta

Some examples were removed for the following reasons:
- Some they were unusually large.  For example 10KB when nearly all examples are 1KB.
Basil Basic isn't very important to WebLogo so we don't want to make the repository much bigger to maintain testable data for Basil Basic.
- Some examples were removed because they were valid code for other dialects of Basic.
We want the examples for testing a language classifier and code that is valid in multiple Basic dialects won't help.
