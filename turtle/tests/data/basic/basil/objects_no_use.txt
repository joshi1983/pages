REM Objects demo: BMX_RIDER and BMX_TEAM
REM This example assumes object support is compiled in with features enabling BMX_RIDER and BMX_TEAM.

#USE BMX_RIDER, BMX_TEAM

REM --- Create riders ---
DIM r1@ AS BMX_RIDER("Alice", 17, "Expert", 12, 3);
DIM r2@ AS BMX_RIDER("Bob", 21, "Intermediate", 5, 10);
DIM r3@ AS BMX_RIDER("Carol", 19, "Pro", 30, 4);

REM Change a few properties after construction
r2@.SkillLevel$ = "Expert";
r2@.Wins% = 8;
r2@.Losses% = 9;

REM --- Create a team (PRO flag available when BMX_TEAM is compiled) ---
DIM t@ AS BMX_TEAM("Rocket Foxes", 2015, PRO);

REM Set some team stats
t@.TeamWins% = 12;
t@.TeamLosses% = 3;

REM Add riders to the team
t@.AddRider(r1@);
t@.AddRider(r2@);
t@.AddRider(r3@);

REM --- Show team summary and rider list ---
PRINT "Team:", t@.Info$();
PRINT "WinPct:", t@.WinPct();

LET names$ = t@.RiderNames$();
PRINT "Riders (", LEN(names$), "):";
FOR i% = 0 TO LEN(names$)-1
  PRINT "  - ", names$(i%);
NEXT i%

REM Also print descriptions from the riders for variety
LET descs$ = t@.RiderDescriptions$();
PRINT "Descriptions:";
FOR i% = 0 TO LEN(descs$)-1
  PRINT "  ", descs$(i%);
NEXT i%

REM --- Optionally show full object descriptors ---
LET ans$ = INPUT$("Show object DESCRIBE info for BMX_RIDER and BMX_TEAM? (Y/N): ");
IF ans$ == "Y" THEN BEGIN
  PRINT "\n--- DESCRIBE$(r1@) ---";
  PRINT DESCRIBE$(r1@);
  PRINT "\n--- DESCRIBE t@ ---";
  DESCRIBE t@;
END
