This directory is for BASIC example programs from before 1975.  This isn't a specific dialect of BASIC but we want all of these handled by one of WebLogo's BASIC-to-WebLogo translators.
If no other BASIC dialect is detected, PC Basic should handle it.

Almost all these examples were copied from a book called 101 BASIC Computer Games(https://archive.org/details/ahl-1978-basic-computer-games).
More directly, they were copied from https://github.com/maurymarkowitz/101-BASIC-Computer-Games.
Some changes were made to the files from what was downloaded from that repository to reflect important corrections to what the book's code actually had.
For example, many spaces were added to some code where the github repository code was missing them.
