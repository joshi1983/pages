GWBASIC is a subdirectory of QBASIC because:
- GWBasic is very similar to QBASIC.
- QBASIC and GWBASIC were both made by Microsoft.
- WebLogo has code for translating QBASIC to WebLogo but not GWBASIC.
Until GWBASIC has a separate translator to WebLogo, the QBASIC translator should
act as a GWBASIC to WebLogo translator.
