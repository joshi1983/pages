Similar to the gwbasic directory, the msxbasic directory is within qbasic because:
- MSXBASIC and QBASIC are very similar.
- Both were made by Microsoft.
- There is no more specialized parsing or translation code in WebLogo yet so MSXBASIC will be translated by essentially the same modules and JavaScript as QBASIC, GWBASIC, and QB64.
