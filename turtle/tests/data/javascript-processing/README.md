This is for examples using the P4 and P5.js 
JavaScript libraries.

"Processing" usually refers to a language that is essentially the Java programming language.
P4.js, P5.js are libraries for the JavaScript programming language.
These libraries work in a similar way to Processing but adapt it for JavaScript similar to how
Python's turtle package adapt turtle graphics from the Logo programming language
for Python.
