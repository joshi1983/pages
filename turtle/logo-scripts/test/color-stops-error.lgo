; I'm seeing an error
; The value assigned to colorstops doesn't match any acceptable data type. The types that won't lead to an error were narrowed down to nothing.
; Also:
; The color stops parameter to the createLinearGradient command requires at least 2 color stops but you provided only 0
; There should be no errors since this might fill in the colorStops properties.

to createLinearGradientForTriangle :height :colors
	localmake "fromPos pos
	localmake "colorStops createPList
	repeat count :colors [
		setProperty :colorStops repRatio item repcount :colors
	]
	jumpForward :height
	localmake "result createLinearGradient :fromPos pos :colorStops "pad
	jumpTo :fromPos
	output :result
