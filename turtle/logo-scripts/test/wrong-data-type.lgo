; The bug here is fromPoint is determined to be a "num" when it should be a list.
; The code isn't running because of the bug.
; The messages are:
; Line 18: jumpTo command requires input of type(s) list The given data types were found to be num Click jumpTo to learn more about the command and its parameters.
; Line 21: jumpTo command requires input of type(s) list The given data types were found to be num Click jumpTo to learn more about the command and its parameters.
; fromPoint is likely determined to be a num because of the pritn round :fromPoint / :groupSize line.
; If points was determined to be a list of list instead of just a list, the error messages would be much clearer.
; Notice that only pos gets added to points meaning we should know the type of every element in points is a list.
