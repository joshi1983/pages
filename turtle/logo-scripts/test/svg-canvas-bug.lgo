; Steps to reproduce bug:
; 1. Include the logo-scripts/test/svg-canvas-bug.svg' in your assets.
; 2. run this code.
; 3. Notice the aspect ratio in canvas.  Click Drawing -> Download.
; Notice that the SVG has a different aspect ratio in SVG.
; That's the bug.
; We want everything drawn in canvas to be the same in SVG.

; Notice that height, width, and viewBox are not specified in the SVG.
; That seems to be part of what causes the bug but we should be able to work around that.
; WebLogo could automatically add a width, height, viewBox when it isn't 
; specified in RasterRectangle when processing the data URL of an SVG.
; Ideally, we'll get a width, height that corresponds with the dimensions used by
; an SVG image element referencing the same SVG, though.
