; Similar to _cv function from QB64 specifically when the type is _INTEGER64.
; QB64's _CV function is documented at:

to cvInteger64 :s
	assert 8 = count :s
	localmake "result 0

	; Avoid bitShiftLeft, bitOr because those commands don't 
	; work well with integers over 32 bits.
	; We'll use * and + operators instead.
