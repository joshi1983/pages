; It looks like the Commadore64 Logo interpreter
; had a "star" command built in.
; A similar procedure was added below.
to star :size
	repeat 5 [
		forward :size
		right 144
	]
	closePath
end

to circleStars
	repeat 12 [
		star 30
		right 30
		; jump so we don't need to call penUp and penDown.
		jumpForward 40
	]
end
