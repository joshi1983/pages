<p>Spread methods are used in gradients.
A spread method indicates how colours are calculated outside the main gradient's range.</p>
<p>For example, a linear gradient will blend through 2 or more color stops between 2 points.  The colours used beyond those 2 points is determined by the spread method.
For radial gradients, the main range is from radius 0 out to a specified radius.  At that radius * 1.1, radius * 2... the colour is determined by the spread method.</p>
<p>The following spread methods are supported in WebLogo:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="border-spread-pad"><strong>Pad</strong> - The final color stop color is used after the gradient range ends.
	In other words, you get a solid, constant colour outside the main gradient interval.  Pad is the default spread method, when you don't need to specify one.</li>
	<li class="border-spread-reflect"><strong>Reflect</strong> - The gradient pattern reverses direction after the end.
	Beyond stop point 1 looks like a reflection.  The pattern will repeat in pairs of 2.</li>
	<li class="border-spread-repeat"><strong>Repeat</strong> - The gradient repeats.
	After colour stop at 1, the colours immediately go to colour stop 0 and increase again.</li>
</ul>
