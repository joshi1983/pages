	Every variables and parameter in the Logo programming language 
	has a value.  Each value is part of at least one data type.
	</p>
	<p>A datatype is a set of values.  For example, the number type represents the set of all numbers.
	Values such as 1000, -15, 1, 3.14 are all numbers.  In WebLogo, some values can fit into multiple data types.
	For example, 5 is both a number and a color.  
	As a color, 5 is the 5<sup>th</sup> color from a color palette which is <span style="background-color: #f0f;height: 14px;width:14px;display:inline-block;margin:0 3px"></span>Fuschia.
	</p>
	<p>Some datatypes have nearly infinite possible values such as list.  Some other data types have very few.  
	True and false are the only boolean values.</p>
	<p>Unlike some other programming languages, 
	Logo never requires you to explicitly declare parameters or variables as specific data types.
	Instead, data types are checked as you type code and run it.
	These checks start with the types from known types for inputs and outputs for 
	built-in commands and operators and work out from there.
