	<p>The Logo programming language supports two general types of operators.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Operators that compare and evaluate to either true or false.  These are symbols like &gt;, &lt;.</li>
		<li>Operators that evaluate to numbers.  These are arithmatic operators like +, -, *, /.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 id="help-operators-unary">Unary Operators</h2>
	<p>A unary operator is an operator that takes 1 input.  For example, the negative sign.  A unary operator appears before its input in a Logo program similar to how a command appears before its input.</p>

	<h2 id="help-operators-comparison">Comparison Operators</h2>
	<p>Comparison operators are useful for <span class="command">if</span>, <span class="command">ifelse</span>, and <span class="command">while-loop</span> commands.</p>
	<div id="bool-operators" class="spreadsheet"></div>

	<h2 id="help-operators-precedence">Precedence</h2>
	<p>Precedence determines the order in which operators are processed.</p>
	<p>If you ever want more control over the order of operations in evaluating your expressions, use curved brackets ( ).  The brackets are always evaluated before anything else.</p>
