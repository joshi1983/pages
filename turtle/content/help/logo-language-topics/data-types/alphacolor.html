<p>An alphacolor or semitransparent color is a color with an associated opacity.</p>
<p>An alphacolor can be desribed in a few different ways:</p>
<ul class="alphacolor-list">
	<li>A name such as "red "green "blue "yellow...  The opacity is assumed to be 100%(or 255) when you use a color name.</li>
	<li>A 3-digit or 6-digit RGB hex code such as #123 or #112233.  The opacity is assumed to be 100%(or 255) when you don't specify opacity.</li>
	<li>An ARGB hex color code such as #f123 or #ff112233.  The opacity is taken from the first digit or digits.  In both of these examples, it would be 255 or 100%.
	#80112233 would have an opacity of 128 which is roughly 50%.  That is 128/255 * 100%.</li>
	<li>A list containing 3 or 4 integers ranging 0..255.
		<ul>
			<li>If the list has 3 numbers, the opacity is assumed 100% or the same as specifying 255.  For example, [255 0 0] represents a fully opaque red color.  It is the same color as indicated by "red.</li>
			<li>If the list has 4 numbers, it is ordered [alpha red green blue].  For example, [128 255 0 0] represents a semitransparent red color.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Some commands often used with alphacolors include <span class="command">setFillColor</span>, <span class="command">setPenColor</span>,
and <span class="command">mix</span> for mixing colors.  You can mix any color with <span class="command">transparent</span> to get a more transparent alphacolor, for example.</p>
