<p>An easing function is a function which converts a ratio(a value from 0 to 1) into another ratio(from 0 to 1).
</p>
<p>
Easing functions are useful for animations when you want to transition from one state to another.
Most easing functions such as <span class="command">easeLinear</span>, <span class="command">easeInOut</span> graph as a smooth line and consequently would lead to smooth movement or other changes in an animation.
Some other ease functions such as <span class="command">easeSteps</span> don't graph smoothly and would cause a jumpy, rigid, robot-like movement in an animation.

Easing functions can also be useful for customizing how colours are blended in colour gradients.
2 colours in a gradient are interpolated by default using easeLinear but you can replace this with other easing functions.

Use the <span class="command">interpolateRatio command</span> to evaluate an easing function on a given ratio.</p>
