<p>A number is what you use in arithmatic.
This could represent an integer like -1 or a real number like 3.14.
Numbers are required by various commands that do math such as
<span class="command">sin</span>, <span class="command">cos</span>,
<span class="command">sqrt</span>, <span class="command">arccos</span>,
<span class="command">ln</span>...
</p>
<p>If you have a numeric-formatted string like indicated by the literal, '123.45', you can convert it to a number using <span class="command">the parseNumber command</span>.</p>
