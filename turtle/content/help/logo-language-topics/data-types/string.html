<p>A string is a data type for representing textual information like "hello or 'hello world'.
A string in a computer programming context almost always is short for character-string or
characters that have been connected/strung together into a sequence.
A string data type is very different from the kind of colorful string/thread/fabric of material used in string-art and clothing.</p>

<h3>Classical String Literals</h3>
<p>
A string is usually indicated starting with a quote symbol and
followed by the characters of your word.</p>
<p>
For example, <code><span class="command">print</span> "hello</code>
</p>
<h3>Long String Literals</h3>
<p>
Another way to represent a string is by beginning and ending with an apostrophe.
This apostrophe format is most useful to indicate long strings containing multiple
words, spaces, or special characters.  The long string literal format is used for URL's too.
</p>
<p>
For example, <code><span class="command">print</span> 'hello world'</code>
</p>
<h3>Escaping Special Characters</h3>
<p>
If a quote marks the end of a string literal, how do you include a quote in your string?
You escape it.  Use the \ character before the character you want to escape.  
This will work in both conventional string literals(") and long string literals.
</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<code><span class="command">print</span> 'It\'s a beautiful day!'
<span class="command">print</span> "It\'s</code>
