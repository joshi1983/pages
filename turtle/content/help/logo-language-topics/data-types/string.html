<p>
A string is usually indicated starting with a quote symbol and followed by the characters of your word.
For example, <span class="command">print</span> "hello
</p>
<p>
Another way to represent a string is by beginning and ending with an apostrophe.  
This apostrophe format is most useful to indicate long strings containing multiple words, spaces, or special characters.
For example, <span class="command">print</span> 'hello world'
</p>
