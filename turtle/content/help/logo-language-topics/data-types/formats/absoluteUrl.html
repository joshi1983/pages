<p>The absolute URL string format is for <strong>u</strong>niversal <strong>r</strong>esource 
<strong>l</strong>ocators(URL's).</p>
<p>A valid absolute URL must always start with a protocol.  These could be http, https, local, or weblogo.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>data</strong> is a protocol for encoding all of the data you want to reference directly in the URL.
	You can use base 64 encoding.  You can convert files to base 64-encoded data URL's on several websites like
	<a href="https://elmah.io/tools/base64-image-encoder/" 
	target="_empty">https://elmah.io/tools/base64-image-encoder/</a> or
	<a href="https://www.base64encode.org" 
	target="_empty">https://www.base64encode.org</a>
	</li>
	<li><strong>http</strong> is a protocol that will get data without any encryption.</li>
	<li><strong>https</strong> is very similar to http except the communication will be encrypted.
	This encryption prevents computers and network devices between your computer and 
	the hosting computer from reading getting sensitive information out 
	of data being sent or received.  
	Many computers and network devices often need to transfer your data anywhere but they do 
	so a bit like a mail delivery person who can't open your mail.</li>
	<li><strong>local</strong> is a protocol for reading data from your assets.  
	Your assets can be accessed through File -&gt; Assets.</li>
	<li><strong>weblogo</strong> is a protocol for reading data from your WebLogo website.
		WebLogo will translate any weblogo:// URL's to match the protocol and base URL of the 
		web page that is hosting your WebLogo program.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>What comes after the protocol depends on the protocol.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For http, and https, you'd often specify a domain name but could replace that with an IP address.
You could indicate a port number(for example :8080).  Then, you specify the path or filename.
For example, https://google.com/directory1/image.jpg or
http://google.com:80/directory1/image.jpg</li>
	<li>For local, it should be just the asset name. For example, local://image.jpg</li>
	<li>For weblogo, it should be the path and file name of the file in 
	your WebLogo programming environment website.  For example, weblogo://logo-scripts/images/sketch-inner.png</li>
</ul>
