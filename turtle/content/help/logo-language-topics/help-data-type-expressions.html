<div class="data-type-expressions">
	<p>Datatype expressions are used in commands like <span class="command">isinstance</span> to clearly describe
	a set of data types.</p>
	<p>The basic rules of WebLogo's datatype expression language are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The supported type names include:
		bool, cproc, easing, gradient, instructionlist, int, num, list, plist, string, transparent.
		Similar names won't work so you can't replace "num with "number or "bool with "boolean.
		</li>
		<li>The <strong>pipe symbol</strong>, |, represents an <em>or</em> operation or <em>union</em>.
		For example, num|string indicates all values that are either numbers <strong>or</strong> strings.</li>
		<li>Some data types have associated template types.  For example, a list represents the set of 
		all lists regardless of datatypes used in any of its elements.
		list&lt;string&gt; represents the set of lists that contain nothing but string values.</li>
		<li><strong>No spaces</strong> - a regular space, tab, line break... are all not allowed.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The following examples should reinforce the basic rules described above.</p>
