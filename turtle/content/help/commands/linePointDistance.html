<code>print linePointDistance [0 0] [1 0] [5 0]
; prints 0 because point [5 0] will 
; be on the line that intersects [0 0] and [1 0]

print linePointDistance [0 0] [0 1] [0 6]
; Also prints 0 because point [0 6]
; will be on the line intersecting [0 0] with [0 1]

print linePointDistance [0 0] [1 0] [0 4]
; prints 4 because [0 4] is 4 away from the line
; at closest

print linePointDistance [0 0] [1 0] [123 4]
; prints 4 because [123 4] is 4 away from the line
; at closest.
; The closest point on the line would be [123 0]
; [123 4] is 4 away from that closest point.</code>
