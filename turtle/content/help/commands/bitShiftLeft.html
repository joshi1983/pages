<code>; shifting by 0 bits just returns the first argument because
; shifting 0 bits isn't changing anything.

print bitShiftLeft 0 0<br>
; prints 0<br>
print bitShiftLeft 1 0<br>
; prints 1<br>
print bitShiftLeft -1 0<br>
; prints -1
print bitShiftLeft 2 0<br>
; prints 2

print bitShiftLeft 1 1<br>
; prints 2 because binary for 1 is 1.
; Shifting the bits to the left is the same as adding a 0 to the right.
; The shift gives you the binary 10.
; The value of binary 10 is 2.

print bitShiftLeft 4 1<br>
; prints 8 because 4 is 100 in binary and 
; adding a 0 on the right of that
; would be 1000 in binary which has the value 8.

print bitShiftLeft 5 1<br>
; prints 10
; 5 in binary is 101.
; Shift those bits 1 binary digit to the left and you get 1010.
; The value of binary 1010 is 10.

print bitShiftLeft -5 1
; prints -10
; Similar to bitShiftLeft 5 2 but preserving the sign

print bitShiftLeft 5 2
; prints 20 because binary for 5 is 101.
; Shift those to the left by 2 bits and you get 10100.
; The value of 10100 read as binary is 20.</code>
