<p>The stepPosition parameter defines what happens whether or not the step jumps at the first and last steps.
The stepPosition parameter can be one of:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>jumpStart</strong> - jump at the first step but not the end.  The first step will not be at 0 but the last step will be at 1.</li>
	<li><strong>jumpEnd</strong> - jump at the end step but not the first.  The first step will be at 0 but the last step will not be at 1.</li>
	<li><strong>jumpBoth</strong> - jump at both first and end step.  The first step will not be at 0 and the end step will not be at 1.</li>
	<li><strong>jumpNone</strong> - never jump at the first or last steps.  The first step will be at 0, last at 1.  Each jump in the middle are higher.</li>
</ul>
