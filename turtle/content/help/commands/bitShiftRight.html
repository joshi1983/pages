<code>; shifting by 0 bits just returns the first argument because
; shifting 0 bits isn't changing anything.

print bitShiftRight 0 0
; prints 0
print bitShiftRight 1 0
; prints 1
print bitShiftRight -1 0
; prints -1
print bitShiftRight 2 0
; prints 2

print bitShiftRight 2 1
; prints 1 because binary for 2 is 10.
; Removing the right-most binary digit gives you 1.
; The value of binary 1 is just 1.

print bitShiftRight 4 1
; prints 2 because 4 is 100 in binary and losing 1 bit
; would be 10 in binary which has the value 4.

print bitShiftRight 5 1
; prints 2
; 5 in binary is 101.
; Remove the last bit and you get 10.
; The value of binary 10 is 2.

print bitShiftRight 5 2
; prints 1 because binary for 5 is 101.
; Remove the right-most 2 bits and you get 1.</code>
