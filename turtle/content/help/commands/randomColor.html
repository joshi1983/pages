<code>; myRandomColor procedure works exactly like the randomColor command.
; The randomColor command is available so you don't need to implement it yourself.
; Reviewing this implementation could help you implement something similar using procedures, though.

print myRandomColor

<code>print randomColor
; Printed [23 73 203] but will likely 
; print different numbers the next time you run it</code>
