<code>square 50
; Draws a square with width 50 and height 50</code>
<code>; Behaves exactly like square command.
; The square command is available so you don't need to implement it yourself.
; Reviewing this implementation could help you implement something similar using procedures, though.

; mySquare2 also does the same as the square command but implemented using regularPolygon.

	regularPolygon :size / 2 / cos 45 4
	left 45 ; restore original heading.

; mySquare3 also does the same as the square command but implemented using polyStart, polyEnd...
