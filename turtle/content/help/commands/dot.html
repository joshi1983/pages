print dot [1 2 3] [4 -5 6]
; prints 12
; The value is calculated as follows:
; 1 * 4 + 2 * -5 + 3 * 6
; = 4 - 10 + 18
; = -6 + 18
; = 12

print dot [-4 -9] [-1 2]
; prints -14
; The value is calculated as follows:
; -4 * -1 + -9 * 2
; = 4 + -18
; = -14</code>
<code>; myDotProduct procedure works exactly like the dot command.
; The dot command is available so you don't need to implement it yourself.
; Reviewing this implementation could help you implement something similar using procedures, though.
to myDotProduct :list1 :list2
	localmake "result 0
	repeat count :list1 [
		localmake "result :result + 
			(item repcount :list1) * (item repcount :list2)
	]
	output :result
end

print myDotProduct [1 2 3] [4 -5 6]
; prints 12
; just like print dot [1 2 3] [4 -5 6]

print myDotProduct [-4 -9] [-1 2]
; prints -14
; just like print dot [-4 -9] [-1 2]</code>
