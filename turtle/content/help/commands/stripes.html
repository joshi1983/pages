<code>; myStripes procedure behaves exactly like stripes command.
; The stripes command is available so you don't need to implement it yourself.
; Reviewing this implementation could help you implement something similar using procedures, though.

; The following will look similar to the other example
; because myStripes works the same way as the stripes command.
