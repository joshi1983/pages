<code>print vectorAdd [] []
; prints []

print vectorAdd [2] [3]
; prints [5]
; because 5 = 2 + 3

print vectorAdd [1 2] [1 2]
; prints [2 4]
; That is from evaluating [(1 + 1) (2 + 2)]

print vectorAdd [1 2] [1 1]
; prints [2 3]

; That is from evaluating [(1 + 1) (2 + 1)]
; 2 = 1 + 1
; 3 = 2 + 1
; so [2 3]</code>
