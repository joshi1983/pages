<code>; myPolygon procedure works similar to the polygon command if the points are only for 2D graphics.
; myPolygon won't work well with arbitrary 3D points, though.
; Nevertheless, reviewing this could help you understand the polygon command.
; It can also help help you implement similar procedures that work slightly differently if you don't like
; how the polygon command works.
