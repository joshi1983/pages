<code>regularStar 100 5
; Draws a 5-pointed regular star similar to the shape you see in many places.</code>
<code>; myRegularStar procedure works exactly like the regularStar command.
; The regularStar command is available so you don't need to implement it yourself.
; Reviewing this implementation could help you implement something similar using procedures, though.
