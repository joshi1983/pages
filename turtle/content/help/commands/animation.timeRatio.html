<code>print animation.timeRatio
; Usually prints 0 unless you're creating an animation

print ['time=' animation.time]
print ['duration=' animation.duration]
print ['time/duration=' animation.time / animation.duration]
print ['timeRatio=' animation.timeRatio]
; Always prints the same value as animation.time / animation.duration</code>
