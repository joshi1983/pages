<code>print animation.timeRatio
; Usually prints 0 unless you're creating an animation

print ['time=' animation.time]
print ['duration=' animation.duration]
print ['time/duration=' animation.time / animation.duration]
print ['timeRatio=' animation.timeRatio]
; Always prints the same value as animation.time / animation.duration

print ['clamped timeRatio=' clamp animation.timeRatio 0 1]
; prints the same as animation.timeRatio unless
; animation.timeRatio is less than 0 or greater than 1.
; animation.timeRatio might be something like -0.05
; while processing motion blur for the first frame of an animation.

print ['clampedTimeRatio=' animation.clampedTimeRatio]
; Always prints the same as clamp animation.time 0 1</code>
