<code>print vectorSubtract [] []
; prints []

print vectorSubtract [2] [3]
; prints [-1]
; because -1 = 2 - 3

print vectorSubtract [1 2] [1 2]
; prints [0 0]
; That is from evaluating [(1 - 1) (2 - 2)]

print vectorSubtract [1 2] [1 1]
; prints [0 1]

; That is from evaluating [(1 - 1) (2 - 1)]
; 0 = 1 - 1
; 1 = 1 - 2
; so [0 1]</code>
