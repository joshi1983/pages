<div class="differences-from-fms-logo">
	<p>
		The following comparisons will be useful for anyone familiar with FMSLogo or UCBLogo and want to learn WebLogo.
		This may be useful if you want to convert FMSLogo scripts into WebLogo scripts.
	</p>
	<p>
		FMS Logo has a lot in common with WebLogo but also a lot of differences.
	</p>

	<h3>WebLogo is Far More Portable</h3>
	<p>As a web application, WebLogo works on far more operating systems and devices than FMS Logo which was for Windows.</p>

	<h3>Different Focus</h3>
	<p>
		To be great at something often requires focus and specialization.
		WebLogo focuses on making beautiful drawings and being easy to learn.
		WebLogo does not try to be a general-purpose or low-level programming tool.  
	</p>
	<p>
		FMSLogo supports a lot of other features.
		WebLogo does not have commands or features for CD-rom control, 
		low-level networking, serial port communication, 
		creating buttons or
		general-purpose interactive applications out of Logo scripts, or 
		have examples on compiling Pascal code.
	</p>

	<h3>WebLogo Treats Commander-specific Commands Differently</h3>
	<p>
		The following are FMSLogo commands that can be better done by other features of WebLogo:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>cleartext</strong> since you can click the clear text messages button.</li>
		<li><strong>edall</strong> which opens the editor.  This can be done by clicking the Edall button or <strong>File</strong> -&gt; <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>
		<li><strong>edit</strong> which is almost the same as edall</li>
		<li><strong>halt</strong> since you can click the pause button in the commander.</li>
		<li><strong>slowdown</strong> and <strong>slowdraw</strong> since execution speed can be controlled by <strong>Debugging</strong> -&gt; <strong>Maximum Speed</strong>, <strong>Debugging</strong> -&gt; <strong>Slow</strong>...</li>
		<li><strong>zoom</strong> since zoom can be controlled with the menu 
		<strong>Zoom</strong> -&gt; <strong>In</strong>, <strong>Zoom</strong> -&gt; <strong>Out</strong> and using a mouse wheel while your cursor is hovered over the graphics screen.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		For your convenience and familiarity, some of those trigger similar functionality
		when run from the Commander but they're not really commands in WebLogo and won't work in Logo procedures.
	</p>

	<h3>WebLogo Does Not Wrap Graphics Screen</h3>
	<p>
	If a drawing or the turtle moves out of the visible rectangle on the screen in WebLogo, it simply stops being visible.
	You can drag to move the camera or zoom out to see more of the drawing and turtle.
	</p>
	<p>Anything disappearing off the right of the FMS Logo graphics screen, reappears on the left side and similar in the vertical directions.</p>
	<p>
	The reason WebLogo uses its approach is to make the experience of viewing the drawing more similar to how
	nearly all content is viewed in other software.  A few similar examples are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>When a web page is taller than can fit in the viewport of a web browser, 
		you scroll to see it much like you would drag to see it in WebLogo.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>More consistent boolean expressions</h3>
	<p>
		Boolean(true/false) conditions are treated the same by WebLogo no matter where they are.
		It doesn't matter if the evalated value is printed or used in a control-structure such as an 
		<span class="command">if-statement</span>, <span class="command">while</span>, or <span class="command">until</span> loop.
	</p>
	<p>
		That is different from FMSLogo when it comes to while and until loop conditions.
		FMSLogo expects a list for conditions in while and until loops but does not in an if-statement.
	</p>
	<h4>FMSLogo Example</h4>
	<code>make "x 0<br>
; FMSLogo-style while-loop.  Notice [] brackets for condition:<br>
while [5 &gt; :x] [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;make "x :x + 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print :x<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print :x &lt; 2 ; prints true or false<br>
]<br>
; if-statement condions written without [] brackets in FMSLogo:<br>
if :x &lt; 2 [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print "xx<br>
]</code>
	<h4>WebLogo Example</h4>
	<code class="pastable">make "x 0<br>
; WebLogo-style while-loop.  Notice lack of [] brackets for condition:<br>
while 5 &gt; :x [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;make "x :x + 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print :x<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print :x &lt; 2 ; prints true or false<br>
]<br>
; if-statement condition same in both versions.<br>
if :x &lt; 2 [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print "xx<br>
]</code>

	<h3>[ Square Brackets ]</h3>
	<p>
		Square brackets in WebLogo and FMSLogo indicate a list but the contents of the lists are evaluated differently.
		WebLogo always looks for calls to commands, procedures, and treats something as a string literal only when " symbol is found.
		In other words, the list command is much less useful in WebLogo since the contents of a square-bracketed expression
		are treated the same as calling the list command.
	</p>
	<p>This difference is demonstrated by the following examples.</p>

	<h4>Example with FMS Logo</h4>
	<code>; print a list in FMSLogo<br>
print [1 2 3]<br>
; prints 1 2 3<br>
print [1 2 pi]<br>
; prints 1 2 pi<br>
print (list 1 2 pi)<br>
; prints 1 2 3.14159265358979<br>
<br>
print [hello world]<br>
; Notice the lack of quotes.
; prints [hello world]<br>
print [1 2 pi]<br>
; prints [1 2 3.14159] in WebLogo but different from FMSLogo<br>
print (list 1 2 pi)<br>
; prints [1 2 3.14159] in both versions<br>
<br>
; for-loop in FMSLogo:<br>
for [x 0 5 1] [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print :x<br>
]</code>

	<h4>Similar Example for WebLogo</h4>
	<code class="pastable">; print a list in WebLogo<br>
print [1 2 3]<br>
; prints [1 2 3]<br>
<br>
print ["hello "world]<br>
; Notice the quotes.<br>
; prints [hello world]<br>
<br>
; for-loop in WebLogo:<br>
for ["x 0 5 1] [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print :x<br>
]</code>
	<h3>Differences with Property List Commands</h3>
	<p>
	The underlying property list data type should be the same but some commands are different enough 
	that new command names were chosen to clarify the difference.
	</p>
	<p>The commands in FMS Logo create property lists for global variables but don't work for local variables.  
	This limitation is why WebLogo creates property lists differently.</p>
	<p>
	Instead of pprop both setting properties and creating new property lists, the <span class="command">setProperty command</span> only sets properties on an existing property list that was created using <span class="command">plistCreate</span>.
	This way, you can use <span class="command">localmake</span> or <span class="command">make</span> to assign your property lists to local or global variables.</p>
	<h3>Animation</h3>
	<p>WebLogo makes it easier to create and export animations.</p>
	<p>Animations in FMS Logo usually use the <strong>wait</strong> command or <strong>gifsave</strong> command.
	Viewing an animation within FMS Logo tends to be flickery because you see the slow drawing process between each frame.</p>
	<p>WebLogo lets you turn any drawing into an animation by making use of the animation time anywhere in your script.
	WebLogo automatically generates code to help you indicate properties of your animation such as duration.
	Another procedure called animation.snapshot lets you indicate properties that change with time such as 
	zoom, and what part of the drawing you want to show.
	</p>
	<p>WebLogo lets you download a frame sequence.
	A frame sequence gives you the best flexibility to use the animation data
	without any loss of quality and with the widest variety of third party software.
	You can use the frame sequence in many other animation applications such as ffmpeg.
	This enables you to eventually make mp4 and other video formats combined with audio.
	The frame sequence can be made with any standard frame rate, resolution,
	rasterized image format and with motion blur.
	</p>
	<h3>Minor Command Differences</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="command">pos</span> returns a list of 3 numbers(x y z) but FMSLogo returns only 2(x y).
		Although deviating from FMSLogo has drawbacks, the z-coordinate is part of the turtle's position so 
		adding z seemed like a worthwhile improvement.
		
		</li>
		<li><span class="command">setPos</span> can set the z-coordinate while FMS Logo could only set x and y using <span class="command">setPos</span>.  
		setPos in WebLogo works with both a list of length 2 or 3.</li>
		<li><span class="command">setPenSize</span> accepts a number and <span class="command">penSize</span> returns a number.
		FMSLogo's penSize commands work with a list of 2 numbers representing sizes in 2 directions.
		Usually people just copied the number so a size of 5 would be indicated with [5 5].  
		This extra complexity didn't seem worth keeping so WebLogo works with a single number.</li>
	</ul>
