<h3>animation.setup</h3>
<p>
The animation.setup procedure returns a property list defining information about the animation as a whole.
animation.setup should never call <span class="command">animation.time</span> or try to draw anything.
</p>

<h4>Properties</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>duration</strong> is the number of seconds of duration</li>
	<li><strong>thumbnailTime</strong> is the number of seconds to the best still frame to depict the animation.
	This time is the same frame initially shown in <strong>File</strong> -&gt; <strong>Load Example</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>Don't</h4>
<p>The animation.setup is not to be used for anything except defining properties for the overall animation listed above.
Keep that clear by avoiding the following mistakes.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Don't use a case for property names other than the ones specified above.
	For example, don't use DURATION instead of duration because the property names in a property list are case-sensitive.</li>
	<li>Don't add parameters to the animation.setup procedure since it should never have any.</li>
	<li>Don't call <span class="command">animation.duration</span> within animation.setup.  The result of animation.duration is the same as the duration property of animation.setup's procedure.
	Calling <span class="command">animation.duration</span> is both asking for an endless cycle and serves no sensible purpose.</li>
	<li>Don't call <span class="command">animation.time</span> within animation.setup.  animation.setup should behave the same way irrespective of time.
	Calling <span class="command">animation.time</span> within animation.setup is a bit like asking what happened before the existence of time.
	</li>
	<li>Don't try to draw anything in animation.setup.  Don't call commands like <span class="command">forward</span> in animation.setup.
	animation.setup is for indicating settings for your animation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>The following indicates the animation is 10 seconds long.</p>
<code class="pastable">to animation.setup
	localmake "minutes 0
	localmake "seconds 10
	; Edit this if you want to change the length of your animation.
	output createPList2 [
		["duration :minutes * 60 + :seconds]
	]
end</code>
