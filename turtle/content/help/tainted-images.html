<p>An image can be added to a drawing using the <span class="command">image</span> or 
<span class="command">imageAlpha</span> commands.
An HTTP or HTTPS protocol URL for the source parameter of those commands
often adds a "tainted" image to the drawing.
In other words, the image becomes troublesome for some features of WebLogo to work with.
</p>
<p>
If you want more technical details, this "tainted" image is more of a "tainted" HTML5 canvas caused by
drawing an unsafe or tainted image onto the canvas.
The security issue that causes canvases to become tainted is explained in detail at

<p>Some features won't work on drawings with tainted images.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Drawing</strong> -&gt; <strong>Download</strong> feature from working 
for JPG, PNG, WebP formats due to an underlying browser security feature.</li>
	<li>Since you can't download raster images from drawings containing tainted images, you also can't export animations that contain tainted images.</li>
	<li>Under <strong>Set</strong> -&gt; <strong>Set Time</strong>, the Live Redraw will stop working</li>
</ul>
<h3>Workarounds</h3>
<p>You can add an image as an asset and reference it using a url like
local://myimage.png assuming you have a PNG image asset named myimage.png.
This is usually the best workaround since it keeps your code small.  
Click <strong>File</strong> -&gt; <strong>Assets</strong> to access the asset manager.</p>
<p>You can work around this by using base-64 data URL's.
The drawback is your URL will become very long. It'll quite surely be too long see within the code editor unless you scroll.</p>
