<p>Pen contact is whether the pen is up or down.  Similar to a pen and paper, the pen must be pressed down when it moves or no lines are drawn.</p>

<p>The pen can be pressed down using the <span class="command">pendown command</span>.
The pen can be lifted up using the <span class="command">penup command</span>.
You can also use the <strong>Set</strong> -&gt; <strong>Lift Pen Up</strong> or <strong>Set</strong> -&gt; <strong>Put Pen Down</strong> menu item.</p>

<p>You can see if the pen is down by reading either "Up" or "Down" in the status feature.  
In a Logo program, you can also use the <span class="command">penDown? command</span>.</p>
