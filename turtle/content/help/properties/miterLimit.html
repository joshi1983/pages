	<p>The miter limit determines how large miter joins can get before a bevel joint is used instead.
	The miter limit affects only paths, only when the pen is visible, and only when the lineJoinStyle is miter.</p>

	<p>Say you have a miter joint for a corner that turns 30 degrees.  The miter joint point won't be far from the point where the 2 line segments meet.
If lines join that change direction by close to 180 degrees, the miter join point can be 1000's of times farther than the pen size or width.
Instead of having some joints in a path span 100's or 1000's of times the pen thickness, you'll often prefer beveling the joint.</p>
<p>By default, a miter join point that is more than 10 times 
the penSize away from the line joint will be drawn with bevel.
You can set the miter limit to any positive number you want.
You can set the miter limit to 0 but that will have almost the same effect as setting line join style to bevel.
A miter limit of 0 means every joint will be bevelled instead of mitered even if line join style is miter.

	<p>The miter limit can be set using the <span class="command">setMiterLimit command</span>.</p>
	<p>The miter limit can also be read using the <span class="command">miterLimit command</span>.</p>

	<p>See also the <span data-helpid="line-join-style">line join style</span> property which could be miter, round, or bevel.</p>
