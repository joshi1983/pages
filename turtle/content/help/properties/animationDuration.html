<p>Animation Duration is how long your animation lasts.</p>

<p>Animation duration can be read using the <span class="command">animation.duration command</span>.
If you define a procedure named animation.setup procedure, it should return the animation duration in seconds.</p>

<p>If you haven't defined an animation.setup procedure, you can add one through the editor's menu by clicking 
<strong>Edit</strong> -&gt; <strong>Set up Animation</strong>.</p>
