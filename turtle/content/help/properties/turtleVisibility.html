<p>The turtle's visibility determines whether the turtle is shown in the graphics area or not.
Showing it helps you follow the execution of your Logo program as it draws a picture.
It shows where and with what orientation the turtle is at.</p>
<p>The turtle's visibility can be set using <span class="command">showturtle</span> and <span class="command">hideturtle</span> commands.  It can also be set using the Set menu's turtle visibility item.  The menu item will say "Show Turtle" or "Hide Turtle" depending on the current state of the turtle.</p>
<p>You can check if the turtle is visible by looking for it in the graphics screen near your drawing or in the status feature.</p>
