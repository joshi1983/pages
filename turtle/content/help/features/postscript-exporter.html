<p>The PostScript exporter is available for some drawings after clicking <strong>Drawing</strong> -&gt; <strong>Download</strong>.</p>
<p>The PostScript exporter lets you download files that express how the drawing should be printed to paper.</p>
<p>The PDF format is generally more useful so the <span data-helpid="pdf-exporter">PDF exporter</span> is often what you want when it is available for your drawing.  
PostScript is an older format and a scripting language so it can be useful if you want to study its language.</p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Not all drawings can be exported to PostScript.  Some features don't export well so the option is hidden.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gradients don't export so drawings using them can't be exported to PostScript</li>
	<li>Alphacolors/semi-transparent fill colors can't be exported to PostScript</li>
	<li>3D shapes such as spheres, cyllinders, cones aren't represented in PostScript so drawings containing them are not exported to PostScript.</li>
</ul>
