<p>The <strong>wrap turtle state</strong> feature can be triggered by placing your cursor in the 
procedure's code in the code editor and keying <strong>ALT+T</strong>.
</p>
<p>Wrap turtle state inserts 2 lines to a procedure to read and restore the complete state of the turtle.
This is frequently done in WebLogo procedures so your procedure can be called without the calling code worrying about 
unwanted side effects of calling your procedure.</p>
<p>
There are many cases where you want a procedure to draw something but restore the original 
state of the turtle.  Any time you move the turtle, turn the turtle, change the pen color, fill color.., 
you're changing part of the turtle's state.  If the <span class=\"command\">turtleState</span> is 
read at the beginning of the procedure and setTurtleState is called to restore it at the end, all of your turtle changes get undone.
