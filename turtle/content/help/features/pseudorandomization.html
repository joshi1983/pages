<p>You can access and control the pseudorandomization settings by clicking the 
<strong>Testing</strong> -&gt; <strong>Pseudorandomization</strong> in the 
<span data-helpid="code-editor">Code Editor</span>'s menu.</p>
<p>These settings determine what happens with pseudorandomization upon resetting the program.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can choose to do nothing and let randomized commands behave differently on each run.</li>
	<li>You can do the equivalent of executing the <span class="command">rerandom command</span>.
	You can always add a rerandom command call to your code and use curved brackets to indicate the seed value such as 
	<code>(rerandom 5)</code>.
	Configuring WebLogo to reset the pseudorandom number generator can help with testing, though.</li>
