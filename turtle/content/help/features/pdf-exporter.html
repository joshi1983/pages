<p>The PDF exporter is available for some drawings after clicking <strong>Drawing</strong> -&gt; <strong>Download</strong>.</p>
<p>The PDF exporter lets you download files that express how the drawing should be printed to paper.</p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<h4>Not all drawings can be exported to PDF</h4>
<p>Some features don't export well so the option is hidden.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gradients don't export so drawings using them can't be exported to PDF</li>
	<li>Alphacolors/semi-transparent fill colors can't be exported to PDF</li>
	<li>3D shapes such as spheres, cyllinders, cones aren't represented in PDF so drawings containing them are not exported to PDF.</li>
	<li>Both circular and elliptical arcs can't be exported to PDF.</li>
	<li>Rotated ellipses can't be exported to PDF.</li>
	<li>Paths drawn or filled with miter join style and miter limits other than 10 can't be exported to PDF.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Limited Fonts</h4>
<p>Commands such as <span class="command">setFontFamily</span> and <span class="command">label</span> work 
with a wide variety of fonts supported by web browsers.
Only 14 standard PDF fonts are supported for exporting.  
This means a label in a font like 'Arial' in the drawing may use 'Courier' in the exported PDF.</p>
