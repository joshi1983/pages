WebLogo goes through the following steps to run your code.
<ol>
	<li>The code is converted into a sequence of tokens.  Examples include individual numbers, words, keywords or individual brackets.</li>
	<li>These tokens are converted into a tree data structure called a parse tree.</li>
	<li>The parse tree is then converted into an intermediate language representing the low-level instructions that can execute your code.</li>
	<li>The intermediate or low-level instructions are executed in a loop similar to a Logo program's loop except implemented in another programming language called JavaScript.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Comparisons to Other Interpreters</h3>
<p>Parsing is common to nearly all interpreters but the compile-like feature is not quite as common.  
Java compiles .java source files to .class byte code which is very similar.  Python essentially compiles .py to .pyc.
Some don't use a low-level representation or intermediate language and continually reference the parse tree during execution.
