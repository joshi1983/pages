<p>The string art template drawing exporter helps you turn drawings into physical string art.
</p>
<p>The exporter is available for some drawings when you click <strong>Drawing</strong> -&gt; <strong>Download</strong>.</p>

<h3>Recreating a drawing with help from String Art Template Exporter</h3>
<p>Recreate your drawing with actual string by following these steps:</p>
<div id="string-art-kit-explanation-expanded">
	<ol>
		<li>Click "Download".</li>
		<li>Print the downloaded SVG to any size of paper.  
		You can use <a target="empty" href="https://posterazor.sourceforge.io/">PosteRazor</a> to print a large dot pattern to multiple regular-sized pages that you'd then position together.  
		<a target="empty" href="https://posterazor.sourceforge.io/">PosteRazor</a> makes it possible to print to a physical scale that matches your actual string-artwork using any normal printer.
		A PDF file is also downloaded in case PDF is better supported than SVG in any software you use to print.</li>
		<li>Line up nails to the indicated points.  Use string with similar colour and proportional thickness.</li>
		<li>See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yff93j-dZ9Y">a video tutorial</a> to learn more.</li>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>The option to export a string art template is shown only if the drawing is fairly suitable for string art.  
The following rules are used to decide if a drawing is not suitable enough for string art.</p>
<p>The String Art Template exporter isn't available if the drawing</p>
<ul>
	<li>Has more than 2000 shapes because this would lead to overwhelmingly difficult string art</li>
	<li>There are more than 3000 distinct points because this also would lead to overwhelmingly difficult string art</li>
	<li>Has fill gradients because they're not replicated in string art</li>
	<li>Has 3D shapes such as spheres, cones, toruses</li>
	<li>Has more than 10 large non-line shapes because circles, ellipses, and other non-line shapes can't be easily drawn in string art.  
	The number of tiny circles isn't factored into this rule since they could look like points or nails in string art.</li>
</ul>
