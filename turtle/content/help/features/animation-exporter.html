<p>The animation exporter is available for all animated drawings by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Click <strong>Drawing</strong> -&gt; <strong>Download</strong>.</li>
 <li>Click Animation button.</li>
</ol>
<p>An animated drawing or animation defined by aspects of the code in the code editor.
Having any of the following in your code will cause the Animation button to be visible in the Drawing -&gt; Download feature.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Calls <span class="command">animation.time</span>,
		<span class="command">animation.timeRatio</span>,
		<span class="command">animation.clampedTimeRatio</span></li>
	<li>Defines a procedure called animation.setup</li>
</ul>

<h3>File Menu</h3>
<p>An animation can be downloaded as an <strong>Animated GIF</strong> or a <strong>Frame Sequence</strong>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>An animated GIF can be useful for short, very low-resolution animations.
	An animated GIF should generally be under 10 seconds long, use less than 100 frames, 
	and be under 600 by 600 pixels.</li>
	<li>A frame sequence can be useful for high resolution or longer videos.
	A frame sequence enables you to process the video more with other software such as 
	<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="_empty">ffmpeg</a> to combine the frames into MP4 files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>prefix</strong> is where you select the start to your downloaded file name.
For an Animated GIF, the prefix is the single file name before the trailing .gif.
For a frame sequence, the prefix is the part before the frame index digits and file extension.</p>

<h4>Animated GIF Options</h4>
<p><strong>Repeat Count</strong> is the number of times the animation should repeat after opening it.
1 or Infinite are what most people would choose.  Infinite means the GIF animation will repeat as long as it remains open.</p>

<h4>Frame Sequence Options</h4>
<p><strong>Start index</strong> shows only when you're exporting a Frame Sequence.  
It is the first frame index to be downloaded and defaults to 0.</p>
<h5>End index</h5>
<p><strong>End index</strong> shows only when you'r exporting a Frame Sequence.
The end index is the last index to be downloaded and defaults to -1.
An end index of -1 means you want to download to the very last frame of the animation.</p>
<p>The End index input will turn yellow if its value is not valid with respect to the current start index.
If the end index is positive but less than start index, no frames will be selected which is 
very likely not what you want and the input turns yellow to warn you.
</p>
<p>The <strong>File format for each frame</strong> can be JPG, PNG, or WEBP.</p>
<h5>Lossless Quality</h5>
<p>The Lossless Quality checkbox lets you choose between frames that are</p>
<ul>
	<li>Lossless and large file sizes</li>
	<li>Lossy but small file sizes</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, lossless is checked and usually that is preferred.
A compressed MP4 video will lose some quality but most people don't want to 
sacrifice any quality until encoding that final version.</p>

<h3>Resolution Menu</h3>
<p>You can select from various resolutions.</p>
<p>For animated GIF's, a low resolution is generally recommended.</p>
<p>If you want to share a video on youtube, exporting 4K Ultra HD or higher is generally the best
because some people may watch your videos on 4K or 8K screens.
Your high resolution video will downscale very well to lower resolution screens.</p>

<h3>Timing Menu</h3>
<p>The <strong>Frame rate</strong> is how many frames you want per second.
A low frame rate under 24 is often used with animated GIF's.
24, 25, and 30 are generally preferred if you want to make a video for social media.
30fps is generally the best for facebook and youtube.</p>
<p>The <strong>Motion blur snapshots per frame</strong> lets you select how many snapshots should be blended together for each frame.
The trade-offs are essentially this.  If you use more snapshots per frame, you get a higher quality, smoother looking blur effect.
The downside of a high number of snapshots per frame is that your download takes longer to complete.
A high snapshot per frame number is usually most important when aspects of the video very rapidly move or change.</p>
