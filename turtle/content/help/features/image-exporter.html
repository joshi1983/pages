<p>The image exporter lets you download images of the drawing.</p>
<p>The following explains the image exporter menu.</p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>JPG</strong> is a very popular format that compresses well but does not support transparency.</li>
	<li><strong>PNG</strong> is a very popular format that supports transparency.</li>
	<li><strong>SVG</strong> is a vector-graphics format that is great for icons and logos.  SVG doesn't store data by pixels but instead stores drawing information similar to what your WebLogo code expresses.
	The main advantage of SVG over other formats is that it is that you'll never see pixelation in it unless you embed another rasterized image using <span class="command">the image command</span>.</li>
	<li><strong>WEBP</strong> is a newer standard format mostly used in websites.</li>
</ul>

You can select from a predefined list of popular standard dimensions or 
select a custom resolution by individually setting width and height.</p>
