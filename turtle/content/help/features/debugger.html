<p>The debugger can be accessed by clicking <strong>Debugging</strong> -&gt; <strong>Debugger</strong> in the main menu.</p>
<p>The Debugger lets you look deeply at the state of your running Logo program to investigate problems.</p>

<h3>Global Variables</h3>
<p>The global variables section lists all global variables and their current values.</p>
<p>Global variables are all variables that are not local.  
Global variables are often created while calling the <span class="command">make command</span> but can also be made by <span class="command">for</span>-loops that are not within procedures.</p>

<h3>Call Stack</h3>
<p>Call stack lists all procedure calls that are currently running, if there are any.  Call stacks also shows all parameters and local variables with corresponding values.</p>

<h3>Repcount Stack</h3>
<p>Repcount Stack shows the state of all <span class="command">repeat</span> commands currently executing including their maximum and current values.  Unlike a <span class="command">for command</span>, the repeat command has its counter value accessible through the <span class="command">repcount command</span> instead of a variable so the state of a repeat loop does not show in any other section of the debugger.</p>
