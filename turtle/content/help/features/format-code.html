<p>The Code Editor's <strong>Edit</strong> -&gt; <strong>Format Code</strong> menu item replaces all 
indentation with tabs and breaks lines to a consistent and clear format.
</p>
<p>There are many reasons to carefully format your code.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Consistent indentation improves readability of the code.
		<ul>
			<li>Where a loop begins and ends becomes clearer when the whole loop isn't on a single line.</li>
			<li>The order of instructions is clearer when they're more strictly up and down instead of having many on the same line.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Short code on each line makes it easier to benefit from other features of WebLogo.
		<ul>
			<li>Breakpoints can be added in more places when there are more lines to add them to.</li>
			<li>When your program runs, the progress indicator shows which line is currently executing.  
			It is more informative to know that a line calling 1 command is executing than a line containing 10 commands.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>For the above reasons, maintaining consistent and clear formatting is important in any code you write.</p>
<p>The Format Code feature is useful in the following situations.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You may copy Logo code examples from another websites. 
	Logo programmers sometimes put too many command calls on the same line and manually formatting this can be tedious.</li>
	<li>You manually formatted your code but want any small inconsistencies fixed.</li>
</ul>
