<p>The Code Editor's <strong>Edit</strong> -&gt; <strong>Auto-fix Code</strong> menu item performs various fixes on code in the editor.
</p>
<p>
The auto-fix feature can help anyone migrate code from other Logo programming tools and fix frequent minor mistakes and typos.</p>
<p>
The following are a few specific fixes performed by the Auto-fix Code feature.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Converting code from other Logo programming tools to WebLogo.  Below are some examples:
		<ul>
			<li><code>if [3 &lt; 5] []</code> is converted to <code>if 3 &lt; 5 []</code>.</li>
			<li><code>setPenSize [5 5]</code> is converted to <code>setPenSize 5</code>.</li>
			<li><code>pc 5</code> is converted to <code>setPenColor 5</code>.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fixes to common mistakes for people who are new to Logo programming.  
	For example [1,2,3] gets converted to [1 2 3] since WebLogo does not expect 
	elements in a list to be separated by commas.</li>
	<li>Fixes some cases where quotes are missing.  Here are some examples:
		<ul>
			<li><code>setPenColor red</code> is converted to <code>setPenColor "red</code></li>
			<li><code>make x 5</code> is converted to <code>make "x 5</code></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
