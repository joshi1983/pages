<p>
Now that you've used several commands, variables, and loops, you may want to create your own command out of them.
</p>
<p>You can draw a square like this:</p>
<code class="pastable">repeat 4 [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;forward 100<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;right 90<br>
]</code>

<p>You can also make that drawing available the same way you call a command by defining a procedure like the following.</p>
<code class="pastable">to drawSquare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat 4 [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forward 100<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right 90<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;]<br>
end<br>
<br>
drawSquare ; call it like a command</code>
