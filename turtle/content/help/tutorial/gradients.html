<p>The simplest way to color a filled shape like a circle is to 
set fill color using the <span class="command">setFillColor command</span>.
</p>
<code class="pastable">setFillColor "red<br>
circle 100<br>
; fills a circle with a solid red color</code>

<p>You might want to fill a shape with a blend of colors.  
A <strong>gradient</strong> is an area that transitions between more than 1 color.</p>
<p>Defining a gradient requires specifying color stops.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You must indicate a ratio from 0 to 1 for each color stop.
	This ratio indicates where the color appears in the gradient.</li>
	<li>Color stops also require the color.
	The following indicate the color to be red: "red, [255 0 0], or color index.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following defines a variable colorStops for use in a gradient:</p>
<code class="pastable">make "colorStops plistCreate ; create a property list.
setProperty "colorStops 0 "red
setProperty "colorStops 1 "black
; the gradient blends between red and black.
</code>
<p>The commands for creating a gradient include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p><span class="command">createLinearGradient</span> -
		for blending between colors in a single straight direction.
		The perpendicular directions with constant color are also straight.
		</p>
		<img alt="Example of linear gradient" src="content/help/tutorial/images/linear-gradient.svg">
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><span class="command">createRadialGradient</span>
		- for blending between colors in a radiating direction.
		Perpendicular directions with constant color are circular.</p>
		<img alt="Example of radial gradient" src="content/help/tutorial/images/radial-gradient.svg">
	</li>
</ul>

<code class="pastable">make "colorStops plistCreate
setProperty "colorStops 0 "red
setProperty "colorStops 1 "black
; the gradient blends between red and black.

setFillGradient createLinearGradient [0 0] [100 0] :colorStops "pad
circle 200
; draws a circle filled with a gradient that blends
; between red and black
; Point [0 0] is red.
; point [100 0] is black.
; Point [50 0] is an even mix between red and black.
