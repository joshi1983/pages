<p>The most common drawing commands are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="command">fd</span> or <span class="command">forward</span></li>
	<li><span class="command">bk</span>, <span class="command">back</span>, or <span class="command">backward</span></li>
	<li><span class="command">rt</span>, or <span class="command">right</span></li>
	<li><span class="command">lt</span> or <span class="command">left</span></li>
	<li><span class="command">pr</span> or <span class="command">print</span></li>
</ul>
<p>bk, back, or backward represents the same command.
Each of the above commands requires one number as input.
The number adds more information to what the command should do</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>fd 100</code> or <code>forward 100</code> means to "move the turtle forward 100 units".</li>
	<li><code>bk 100</code> or <code>back 100</code> or <code>backward 100</code> mean to "move the turtle backward 100 units".</li>
	<li><code>rt 45</code> or <code>right 45</code> means to "turn the turtle right 45 degrees".</li>
	<li>Try to guess what lt or left does with its input.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The graphics screen has a coordinate system.
If you move your cursor around the graphics screen, 
you'll see the coordinates of the cursor show in the lower right corner.
The turtle is initially at 0, 0 and heads up the y-axis to increased y-coordinates.
X increases as you look toward the right side of the graphics screen.

<h3>Try it for yourself!</h3>
<p>
Type <code class="commander-pastable">forward 100</code> into the text field at the bottom of the web page and click the "Run" button to see the turtle move forward 100 units.
</p>
<p>Here are some more examples.  
Try with different numbers and see how that affects how the turtle moves and rotates.</p>
<ol>
	<li><code class="commander-pastable">forward 100 right 120 forward 100 right 120 forward 100</code></li>
	<li><code class="commander-pastable">forward 100 right 90 forward 100 right 90 forward 100 right 90 forward 100</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Those will run extremely fast.  Slow down how fast those commands execute and run them again.
In the top menu, click <strong>Debugging</strong> -&gt; <strong>Maximum Speed</strong> and replace with
<strong>"Very Slow"</strong>. Watching the code execute slowly sometimes helps you understand it better.
