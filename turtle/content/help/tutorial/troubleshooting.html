<p>You'll run into problems writing your drawings.
That's part of the learning process.
The following are suggestions for each type of problem.</p>

<h3>Trouble With Code Not Running</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Check any red or orange marks beside your code in the <span data-helpid="code-editor">code editor</span> and View Messages.  
	The messages should explain the problem and link to command details that can help you fix it.</li>
	<li>Click <span data-helpid="autofixcode"><strong>Edit</strong> -&gt; <strong>Autofix Code</strong></span> if it is enabled.  This will automatically fix a variety of coding errors.</li>
	<li>If the problem may involve specific commands, or operators, look them up using <strong>Help</strong> -&gt; <strong>Index</strong>.
	You can also click on the command you've written to get details and examples using the command.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trouble With Error While Code Runs</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Look at the error message.  Look at the code at the stopped line number.
	A lot of runtime trouble is caused by violating required data types or ranges for commands.
	For example, if you pass 1.1 as a ratio to the <span class="command">mix command</span>, 
	an error will happen because the mix ratio must be between 0 and 1.</li>
	<li>Running the program again at a slower speed may clarify the problem.  You can control execution speed under <strong>Debugging</strong> -&gt; <strong>Maximum Speed</strong>.</li>
	<li><span data-helpid="debugger"><strong>Debugging</strong> -&gt; <strong>Debugger</strong></span> can show you values of all variables and the procedure call stack.</li>
	<li><span data-helpid="status"><strong>Debugging</strong> -&gt; <strong>Status</strong></span> can show the status of the pen, turtle, fill.</li>
	<li>It may help to add a <span data-helpid="breakpoint">breakpoint</strong> shortly before the line that causes an error.  Rerun the program with the breakpoint and execution will pause upon hitting the breakpoint.  You can then inspect using the <span data-helpid="debugger">debugger</span>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trouble With Drawing Different From Expectation</h3>
<p>Maybe you don't run into an error but the drawing isn't what you expect the code to draw.</p>
<p>A good first step is to narrow down precisely when things deviate from your expectations.
Ultimately, you want to know roughly what line numbers are related to the problem.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A slower execution speed can help you follow the drawing process and decide when things are not matching your expectation.
	You can select a slow or superduper slow speed under the <strong>Debugging</strong> menu.</li>
	<li>You can hit the Pause button to inspect things or change execution speed.</li>
	<li>You could put <span data-helpid="breakpoint">breakpoints</span> in code if you want the program to pause at certain points in code and change execution speed or inspect.</li>
	<li>The <span data-helpid="debugger">debugger</span> and <span data-helpid="status">status</span> features can help you inspect.</li>
</ul>
<p>After finding precisely where things stop matching your expectations,
it can help to click on commands to see if your expectations are violated
by a misunderstanding of what a command should do.</p>

<h3>If Previous Tips Are Not Enough</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
	A program that focuses strictly on your problem can help you focus and figure it out.
	If you have lots of code, you probably don't want to lose it while focusing on the new problem.
	Save your broken code to a file so it can be loaded again later after learning the fix.
	<strong>File</strong> -&gt; <strong>Download</strong> will help you download the Logo source code.
	Make a new WebLogo program that does nothing but reproduce your problem.
	If/when you figure out the fix, save your short code to another file.
	Then, integrate your fix with the larger original code.
	If you don't figure it out, the shorter code can help you share
	the problem with other people who can reproduce your problem and clearly understand you.</li>
	<li>Use a search engine like <a href="https://www.bing.com" target="_blank">bing</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">google</a> to search for similar problems.</li>
	<li>Share your shortened code and question with friends, a teacher, or someone else who used WebLogo.</li>
	<li>You could explain your code and problem with a question on
		<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/</a>.
		Mention that the code is written in WebLogo along with other relavant details so they know how to reproduce your problem.
