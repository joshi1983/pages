<p>
You may want code that decides whether or not to run an instruction list.
</p>
<p>The following will print only if x is less than 10.  Replace 5 and run again to see for yourself.</p>
<code class="pastable">make "x 5<br>
if :x &lt; 10 [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print ["x "is "less "than 10]<br>
]<br>
print "done</code>

<p>You can also choose between 1 of 2 instruction lists by using the <span class="command">ifelse command</span>.
The following example always prints a message regarding x.</p>
<p>
If x &lt; 10, it prints "x is less than 10.<br>
Else, it prints "x is not less than 10".
</p>

<code class="pastable">make "x 5<br>
ifelse :x &lt; 10 [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print ["x "is "less "than 10]<br>
] [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print ["x "is "not "less "than 10]<br>
]</code>
<h3>Example Printing Random Even/Odd Messages</h3>
<p>The following example uses the <span class="command">ifelse command</span> to print whether a randomly selected number is even or odd.</p>
<p>The example makes use of a few new commands:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="command">random command</span> returns a random integer between 0 and a specified maximum.</li>
	<li><span class="command">remainder command</span> returns the remainder after division.  
	<code>remainder 4 2</code> is 0 indicating 4 is even.  <code>remainder 5 2</code> is 1 indicating 5 is odd.</li>
</ul>
<code class="pastable">make "randomNumber random 100<br>
ifelse (remainder :randomNumber 2) = 0 [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print [:randomNumber "is "even]<br>
] [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print [:randomNumber "is "odd]<br>
]<br>
</code>
