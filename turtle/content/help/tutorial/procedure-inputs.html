<p>
When you call <span class="command">penUp</span> or <span class="command">penDown</span>, no inputs are needed.
When you use the <span class="command">forward command</span>, you give it a number to tell it how far to move forward.
You can define these extra inputs in your procedures too.

<p>Here is a procedure to draw a square using a size input:</p>
<code class="pastable">to square :size<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat 4 [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forward :size<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right 90<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;]<br>
end<br>

These inputs or parameters are declared using a few rules:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A procedure input must be on the same line as the procedure's name</li>
	<li>The input must start with a colon</li>
	<li>The input name must follow all the rules of a variable name.  This includes:
		<ul>
			<li>The character after the colon must not be a digit or a period even though 
			digits and periods can be used anywhere later in the name</li>
			<li>Can contain letters, underscores anywhere</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
