<p>
You've learned about global variables 
and using the <span class="command">make command</span>.
You have also used procedures.
You can use global variables in procedures but you might prefer a different kind of variable.
A <strong>global variable</strong> is accessible from code anywhere in your program.  A global variable has a global scope.
</p>
<p>
A <strong>local variable</strong> is only accessible within its procedure.
A local variable has several benefits over global variables.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>You don't need to worry about a local variable being changed outside of the procedure.</li>
	<li>It is easier to understand what your procedure does and does not do
	when there are minimal to no side effects.
	Local variables can be changed without side effects but updating a
	global variable causes a side effect.</li>
	<li>Local variables can be optimized better by WebLogo to help your Logo programs execute faster.</li>
	<li>The more global variables you have in a program, the more likely, you'll confuse
	global variable names with each other.
	Using local variables reduces the number of global variables which makes
	code easier to understand.
	</li>
</ul>
