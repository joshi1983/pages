<p>
The <span class="command">repeat command</span> is very helpful kind of loop but it isn't the only option.
</p>

<h3>For-Loops</h3>
<p>The repcount command used with repeat returns a number starting with 1 and increasing 
by 1 but you might want to start with something other than 1 and increase by something other than 1.
The <span class="command">for</span> is great for that.</p>
<p>The following example prints 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3</p>
<code class="pastable">for ["x 0 3 0.5] [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print :x<br>
]
</code>
<ul>
	<li>"x is a variable name.  It is given a different value each time the instruction list runs.</li>
	<li>0 is the value given to variable x in the first run of your repeated instructions.</li>
	<li>3 is the stop value.  The loop ends when x becomes equal to or beyond the stop value.</li>
	<li>0.5 is the step value.  The step is added to x each time the repeated instructions run.</li>
</ul>

<h3>While-Loops</h3>
<p>Instead of counting how many repetitions you want or adjusting a variable, you might have a more general condition in mind.</p>
<p>The following example prints random numbers while the random number is not 8.  
This can't be done as well with for or repeat loop because the number of repetitions is not the point of our loop condition.</p>
<code class="pastable">make "randomNumber 0<br>
while :randomNumber &lt;&gt; 8 [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;make "randomNumber random 10<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print :randomNumber<br>
]</code>

<h3>Until-Loops</h3>
<p>An <span class="command">until</span> is very similar to <span class="command">while</span> except that the condition means the opposite.  
<span class="command">Until</span> loops repeat until the condition is true instead of looping while the condition is true.</p>
<p>The example below behaves the same as the while-loop above except using an <span class="command">until command</span>.</p>
<code class="pastable">make "randomNumber 0<br>
until :randomNumber = 8 [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;make "randomNumber random 10<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print :randomNumber<br>
]</code>

<h3>Do-While Loop</h3>
<p>A do-while-loop is similar to a while-loop except that the condition is checked after each run of the repeated instructions.</p>
<p>Since the condition is checked only after a random number is assigned to randomNumber, the <code>make "x 0</code> can be removed as shown below.</p>
<code class="pastable">do.while [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;make "randomNumber random 10<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print :randomNumber<br>
] :randomNumber &lt;&gt; 8</code>

<h3>Forever Loops</h3>
<p>The <span class="command">forever</span> loop is available if you want the loop to never stop.</p>
<p>The following example will endlessly print random numbers from 0 to 99(inclusive).</p>
<code class="pastable">forever [<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print random 100<br>
]</code>
