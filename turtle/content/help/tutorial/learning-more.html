	<h4>If Deriving From Other People's Work</h4>
	<p>Sharing is great but be careful if your drawing is derived from copyrighted work.
	If your work is designed to look similar to someone else's image or design,
	review the copyright policy of the other person's work before publicly sharing your version.

	target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APOBZzhDIPA</a> has helpful discussion about
	copyright issues on derivative artwork.</p>
	<p>A lot of the examples in WebLogo involve national flags, images from
	<a href="https://wikipedia.org" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>
	because they tend to be public domain or very unrestricted.
	Any WebLogo examples are provided to learn from but
	a lot are inspired by third party source images.
	You can find the sources of inspiration mentioned in code comments.
	Before sharing any work of yours derived from WebLogo's examples,
	verify that copyright policies of the source images let you do that.
	WebLogo's developers don't want to restrict use of the examples but
	how you use them can be further restricted by their source images.
